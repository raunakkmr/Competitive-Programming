# Competitive-Programming

This repository contains code for [UBC ACM
practices](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~acm-web/practice/) and
[Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) contests. Since there are no marks for
programming style in these contests, the focus is not on coding style, but on
problem solving. Most of the contests are done individually but some are in
teams of 2 or 3.

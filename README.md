# Competitive-Programming

This repository contains code for [UBC ACM
practices](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~acm-web/practice/), [Cornell ACM practices](http://codeforces.com/group/v6MkQyGqda/contests) and
[Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/) contests. The problem statements for each
contest can be found on these websites. Most of the contests are done
individually but some are in teams of 2 or 3.

The focus is on problem solving, and not on coding style. So the code in this
repsitory might not follow good practices!
